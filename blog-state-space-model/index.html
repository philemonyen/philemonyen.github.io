                        In my previous article, I briefly went through the main features of Mamba, a revolutionary model
                        that possesses the potential to challenge the dominance of Transformers in the field of long
                        sequence modeling. To further understand what makes Mamba so powerful, I conducted further paper
                        studies about the core component of Mamba - Structured State Space Model (abbreviated as S4). S4
                        has strong computational versatility enabling efficient computations at different ML model
                        development stages. Additionally, S4 is proven to have better long range dependency (LRD) memory
                        than Transformers, making it a perfect candidate to model very long sequences.</p>
                    <p class=" blog-content">
                        S4 can be decomposed into 2 major components, Structure State Matrix and State Space Model,
                        which consist of a good amount of information. Writing everything in one article will make it
                        too lengthy and consequently downgrading readability. Therefore, I will be writing about state
                        space model today, and focus on structured state matrix in the next article.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content">

                    <h3>State Space Theory</h3>
                    <p class=" blog-content">
                        As S4 draws inspiration from the State Space Model in the context of Control Theory, it is
                        necessary to pick up the fundamentals of state space model (abbreviated as SSM) for better
                        understandings.
                    </p>
                    <h4>State</h4>
                    <p class=" blog-content">
                        Let’s start with the concept of states. States lie within a latent state space and summarize the
                        effect of past inputs on future outputs. In other words, the future of each state only depends
                        on the current state and future inputs since everything about the past is encapsulated in the
                        current state. Therefore, we can view states as the memory of the system.</p>
                    <h4>State Space Model</h4>
                    <p class=" blog-content">
                        With the concept of states in mind, we can move on to learn about SSM. SSM is a representation
                        of the dynamics of an N-th order system as a first order differential equation in an N-vector.
                        This is equivalent to converting the N-th order differential equation that governs the dynamics
                        into N first-order differential equations. In other words, SSM can be viewed as a
                        sequence-to-sequence map that maps input sequence u(t) to output sequence y(t).
                    </p>
                    <p class=" blog-content">
                        The general continuous-time linear state space system formula is defined as
                    </p>
                    <img src="state-space-eq.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">
                        where y, x, u, A, B, C, D, t are output vector, state vector, input vector, state dynamic
                        matrix, input matrix, output matrix, feedthrough matrix, and time, respectfully. Typically, we
                        deal with Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) state dynamics where A,B,C,D are independent of t, so we
                        can leverage the properties of linearity and time invariance for simpler analysis.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Creating State Space Models from Nonlinear Systems</h4>
                    <p class=" blog-content">
                        In order to apply state space theory to general nonlinear systems, we create SSMs about the
                        equilibrium points of the nonlinear system.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" blog-content">Consider a nonlinear set of dynamics given by </p>
                    <img src="nonlinear-dynamic.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">The equilibrium points can be obtained through setting the derivatives of x and u to
                        0. Then,
                        express the state and input equations as</p>

                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">By rewriting the derivative of x with the Taylor series expansion of the equation of
                        Figure 2
                        about the equilibrium points, and we got</p>

                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">where subscript i stands for the i-th element of the vector.</p>
                    <p class=" blog-content">Since the expansion is done about the equilibrium points, the function
                        f in Figure 4 evaluates to 0. Consequently, by combining all state equations for all i, we can
                        obtain</p>
                    <img src="state-update-eq-xu.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">Similarly, by applying the same transformation technique on y and u we can obtain
                    </p>
                    <img src="state-update-eq-yu.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">By dropping the delta symbol, we can obtain the identical SSM formula in Figure 1,
                        showing that
                        we are able to create SSMs from any nonlinear system. Keep in mind that the resulting SSM is not
                        guaranteed to be LTI. If the system was operating around just one set of points, then all the
                        partial fractions in matrices A,B,C,D are constants, and hence the system is an LTI SSM.</p>

                    <h3>Discretizing Continuous State Space Model</h3>
                    <p class=" blog-content">Since computers only operate on discrete numbers, it is crucial to
                        select the proper
                        discretization scheme to transform linear ODEs into discrete update approximation. Among several
                        discretization techniques, I will talk about the two approaches that are employed in related
                        studies - Generalized Bilinear Transformation (GBT) and Zero-Order Hold (ZOH).</p>
                    <h4>Generalized Bilinear Transformation</h4>
                    <p class=" blog-content">Consider a time step size (or timescale), the discretized state update
                        is expressed as</p>
                    <img src="ode-discretization.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">By setting alpha to 1/2, we obtain the GBT update formula which preserves the
                        stability of the
                        system. By organizing the coefficients of x(t) and u(t) into coefficient matrices, we can obtain
                        the discrete SSM formula</p>
                    <img src="discrete-ssm.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <h4>Zero-Order Hold</h4>
                    <p class=" blog-content">Zero-order hold (ZOH) assumes the value of a sample of the input is
                        held constant for a duration
                        of one sample time interval. Consider this assumption, the SSM formula can be discretized as:
                    </p>
                    <img src="zoh-discretization.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p>In the next section, GBT discretization is applied to obtain the discrete SSM. </p>

                    <h3>Linear State Space Layer</h3>
                    <p class=" blog-content">After learning about SSM and discretization, we have acquired the
                        foundation of discrete linear
                        SSM. Gu et al.[1] further introduced a model family called “Linear State Space Layer”
                        (abbreviated as LSSL) to formally define the system. The major feature of LSSL is its ability to
                        simultaneously deliver strengths of RNNs, CNNs, and NDEs. Moreover, LSSL is capable to maintain
                        the equivalent expressivity as corresponding recurrent, convolution, or continuous-time models.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Recurrence View</h4>
                    <p class=" blog-content">Recalling the discrete state update equation in Figure 8, we can easily
                        observe that it is a
                        classic recurrence equation where the recurrent state that carries the context of all inputs
                        before specific time point; hence, LSSL can be viewed as a recurrent model with efficient and
                        stateful inference that requires fixed computation and storage per time step.</p>
                    <p class=" blog-content">In [1], the authors showed two lemmas proving that LSSLs are as
                        expressive as RNNs. First, the ubiquitous gating mechanism is actually an analog of the state
                        size or timescale. Secondly, deep stacked LSSL layers of order N=1 with position-wise
                        nonlinear-functions can approximate any non-linear ODE. As a result, LSSL do not loose modeling
                        power by approximating any nonlinear ODE with discrete linear recurrences.</p>
                    <h4>Convolution View</h4>
                    <p class=" blog-content">LSSL can also be viewed as a convolution model. Let initial state
                        equals 0 for simplicity, then
                        the discrete SSM equations in Figure 8 yields</p>
                    <img src="output-expanded.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">Then y is simply the non-circular convolution</p>
                    <img src="convolution-expression.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">Thus, the entire output of LSSL can be computed with one convolution which can be
                        efficiently
                        implemented with 3 FFTs.</p>
                    <p class=" blog-content">LSSL is also expressive enough to represent convolutions. It is a
                        well-known fact that the output of linear state space systems is related to the input by a
                        convolution with the impulse response of the system. Conversely, a convolutional filter that is
                        a rational function of degree N can be represented by a state-space model of size N.
                        Consequently, any arbitrary convolutional filter can be approximated by a rational function and
                        represented by an LSSL.</p>
                    <h4>Continuous-Time View</h4>
                    <p class=" blog-content">Recalling that LSSL is derived from a linear ODE system, so LSSL itself
                        is still a differential
                        equation. As such, LSSL can perform unique applications of continuous-time models including
                        simulating continuous processes, handling missing data, and adapting to different timescales.

                    <h3>Limitation of Naïve LSSL</h3>
                    <p class=" blog-content">The generality of LSSL combines the advantages of CNNs, RNNs, and NDEs,
                        providing an advanced
                        approach to work on sequence modeling tasks. However, such generality comes with tradeoffs.
                        Naïve LSSL Inherit the limitations of both RNNs and CNNs at remembering long dependencies.
                        Additionally, choosing the appropriate state matrix and timescale is critical to performance,
                        but they are computationally infeasible to learn. As a result, further study on state matrix is
                        required to enhance LSSL performance</p>
