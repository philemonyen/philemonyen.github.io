                        By leveraging the HiPPO theory, S4 serves as a successful enhancement of linear state space
                        layer (LSSL) that possesses the capability to model long sequential data accurately and
                        efficiently. However, nothing is flawless. In order to fully employ the HiPPO theory, S4
                        implements complex parameterization (DPLR) and computation algorithms that require high-level
                        knowledge in advance linear algebra, which consequently raise the difficulty of understanding
                        algorithm details and conducting further analysis. With the motivation of simplifying S4,
                        Diagonal State Space (DSS) is introduced. In this article, we will go through the details about
                        the derivation of DSS, learning how DSS achieve complexity reduction without performance
                        sacrifice</p>
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p class="blog-content">
                        S4 acquires its strong performance in long sequence modeling with a trade-off of model
                        complexity. In order to fully leverage the HiPPO theory, S4 parameterizes the learned state
                        spaces using a Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DPLR) structure and employs several reduction steps and
                        linear algebraic techniques to achieve efficient computation, resulting in a procedure that is
                        difficult to understand, implement, and analyze. Surprisingly, Ankit [1] discovered that S4
                        still holds its performance when the low-rank component of the state matrix was removed, and
                        further embark the investigation in a simplified version of S4 - Diagonal State Space (DSS).</p>
                    <h3>Diagonal State Space</h3>
                    <h4>Zero-Order Hold Discretization</h4>
                    <p class="blog-content">
                        Before we dive into the core of DSS, let’s first talk about the discretization technique DSS
                        used - Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) discretization.</p>
                    <img src="zoh.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">
                        where the ZOH assumption assumes the value of a sample of is held constant for a duration of one
                        sample interval. Comparing to the general bilinear transformation (GBT) discretization employed
                        in S4, ZOH is very simple and easy to implement. Nonetheless, the simplicity of ZOH may suffer
                        from aliasing and distortion when facing high-frequency dynamics.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Core Proposition</h4>
                    <p class="blog-content">
                        DSS is built around a core proposition defined in [1], which is stated as follows:
                    </p>
                    <img src="proposition.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">Let’s translate and summarize this proposition with plain English:
                        For any given state space with
                        a well-behaved state matrix, there exists a DSS, parameterized by a complex vector w and a
                        diagonal matrix &Lambda;, computing the same kernel. In other words, this proposition states that
                        DSS possesses adequate expressivity to represent any well-behaving state space, despite of its
                        simplicity.</p>
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">Unfortunately, there is an underlying risk of numerical
                        instability if we directly used DSS
                        kernels acquired via this equation. There is a chance for the element-wise exponential matrix P
                        to contain large positive values, which will make real parts of elements &Lambda; positive and
                        consequently result in unstable training on long inputs. To address this issue, two variations
                        of DSS are proposed, DSS-EXP and DSS-SOFTMAX.</p>
                    <h4>Variation I - DSS-EXP</h4>
                    <p class="blog-content">
                        This variation augments the proposition by posing an additional restriction to &Lambda;. By
                        restricting the real part of elements of &Lambda; to be negative, the possibility of encountering
                        very large values during kernel computation is directly eliminated. However, this
                        straightforward approach comes with an obvious disadvantage of limiting the learning space of
                        &Lambda;, which consequently reduces model expressivity. Moreover, it is unclear whether the
                        restriction of negative real parts could be detrimental for some tasks. As a result, DSS-EXP
                        provides a simple approach to achieve stable model training while its performance trade-off may
                        restrain its application in specific fields.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Variation II - DSS-SOFTMAX</h4>
                    <img src="dss-softmax.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content">
                        DSS-SOFTMAX handles numerical instability with the concept of softmax normalization. Since
                        ordinary softmax function can have singularities over the complex field and technically does not
                        fully resolve the issue of large positive real parts, an augmented version of softmax function
                        is introduced in [2]. To avoid computing large positive real parts while training, the augmented
                        softmax finds and subtracts the largest real part among row elements. To make the augmented
                        softmax well-defined on the entire complex field, row sums are computed as the square of the
                        modulus to prevent complex division. As a result, DSS-SOFTMAX successfully handles both
                        numerical instability and function singularities without sacrificing the learning space of
                        &Lambda;.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Expressivity & Performance</h3>
                    <p class="blog-content">
                        After learning about the simplification algorithm, let’s move on to how DSS actually performs
                        both theoretically and practically. From the theoretical perspective, we will show that DSS is
                        able to dynamically handle memories depending on the input information. From the practical
                        perspective, we will compare DSS’s performance on sequence modeling tasks with S4 and other
                        effective models.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Theoretical Expressivity - DSS-EXP</h4>
                    <p class="blog-content">
                        With computed &Lambda; and ZOH timestep , we can obtain the discretization with respect to the
                        kernel obtained via equation (1)
                    </p>
                    <img src="dss-exp-discretization.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">When computing the SSM recurrence, the computations of N
                        coordinates are independent since the
                        state matrix is diagonal, so the i-th coordinate can be easily obtained as</p>
                    <img src="dss-exp-element.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">
                        Note that the real parts of lambdas are negative with respect to the restriction of DSS-EXP, we
                        can derive the following two analyses:
                    </p>
                    <img src="dss-exp-analysis.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">By depicting DSS-EXP’s behaviors at two extreme conditions, we can
                        tell that DSS-EXP has expected
                        expressivity to present different scales of history memorization depending on the input context
                        ranging from complete memorization to full forgetting, making it a good candidate for handling
                        long range dependency (LRD).</p>
                    <h4>Theoretical Expressivity - DSS-SOFTMAX</h4>
                    <p class="blog-content">With computed &Lambda; and ZOH timestep Delta, we can obtain the
                        discretization with respect to the kernel obtained via equation (2)</p>
                    <img src="dss-softmax-discretization.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">With the same independence implied with diagonal state matrix, we
                        can compute the SSM recurrence for each coordinate as</p>
                    <img src="dss-softmax-element.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">In order to prevent computing the large sequence length L
                        directly, we compute with a intermediate state</p>
                    <img src="dss-softmax-intermediate.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">In the equation above, we drop the coordinate index i for
                        simplicity and let p be the identity function indicating whether the real part is greater than
                        zero. Straightforwardly, we will conduct our analysis based on the outcome of p.</p>
                    <img src="dss-softmax-analysis.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">We obtain the same conclusion as the previous derivation for
                        DSS-EXP, indicating the DSS-SOFTMAX also possess the desired expressivity to accurately handle
                        LRD.</p>
                    <h4>Empirical Evaluation</h4>
                    <p class="blog-content">Last but not least, let’s look at the empirical evaluation of DSS presented
                        in [1].</p>
                    <img src="evaluation.png" class="blog-img" />
                    <p class="blog-content-no-indent">We can see that DSS obtains comparable performance as S4 in LRD
                        tasks and, same as S4,
                        outperforms Transformer variants by 20% or more in overall accuracy. In conclusion, DSS is
                        proved to have outstanding ability in long sequence modeling from both theoretical and practical
                        point of view, enabling it to be a potential resolution candidate in future LRD tasks</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p class="blog-content">
                        In this article, we go through the core components of the study about DSS, and conclude with its
                        spectacular performance. As an extension of S4 that exploits the HiPPO theory, another research
                        ([2]) were done to investigate the optimal parameterization and initialization for DSS and
                        developed further variants. The studies on DSS, S4, and Mamba open up a new direction of
                        approaching sequence modeling tasks, and further researches must be done to convert them into a
                        foundation model like Transformer.
